**Oh, hey there.**  
Youâ€™ve somehow ended up on my profile. Lucky you! Iâ€™m a **game developer** still figuring it all out, but hey, at least Iâ€™m trying. Right?

---

## What I *Pretend* to Work On:

- **Game Development:** Currently working on *Yurei: Ghost of the Blade*, a 2D action game.
- **Game Design:** Trying to craft a masterpiece, but itâ€™s mostly just me fixing one bug while creating five more. Living the dream.

### Technologies & Tools:

- **Languages:** C#, Java, JavaScript (I *can* Google the rest ðŸ™‚).
- **Game Engines**: Unity (because I like pretending Iâ€™m a pro), GDevelop (for when I want to keep my stress levels low).
- **Tools:** Photoshop (yes, I make art too), Krita, Audacity, Bfxr (sound effects are cool, okay?), Visual Studio (one with all its "features" and the errors), GitHub (obviously), Node.js (when I feel like playing backend dev).

### My Repos That *Definitely* Matter:

- **Yurei: Ghost of the Blade:** A haunting journey with a lot of blade-related drama. My main FYP project.
- **BirdBound:** Youâ€™re a bird. You flap. You go up. Simple as that.
- **Pixel Heights:** Help Kira find her keys and maybe figure out why she keeps losing them. (Itâ€™s a game, not my life storyâ€¦ or is it?)
- **Blog App:** Because the internet definitely needed one more.
- **Expense Tracker:** For when you spend more money on snacks than you should. This app helps you track that bad decision-making.

### Things I Might Do If I Feel Like It:

- Actually finish *Yurei: Ghost of the Blade*. (Youâ€™ll be the first to knowâ€¦ or maybe not. Who knows?)
- Maybe look into **AI in games** and **procedural generation**â€¦ or I could just stick to the basics and call it a day.
- Collaborate with someone who actually knows what theyâ€™re doing. (Hey, a guy can dream.)

Remind me that I still havenâ€™t finished *Yurei*.
