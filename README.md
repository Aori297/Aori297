**Oh, hey there.**  
You’ve somehow ended up on my profile. Lucky you! I’m a **game developer** still figuring it all out, but hey, at least I’m trying. Right?

---

## What I *Pretend* to Work On:
- **Game Development**: Currently making a personal project, a 2D platformer where you help Kira, the world’s most incompetent keykeeper, retrace her steps. (Spoiler: She still doesn’t have the key.)
- **Game Design**: Trying to craft a masterpiece, but it’s mostly just me fixing one bug while creating five more.

---

## Technologies & Tools:
- **Languages**: C#, Java, JavaScript (I *can* Google the rest).
- **Game Engines**: Unity (because I like pretending I’m a pro), GDevelop (for when I want to keep my stress levels low).
- **Tools**: Photoshop (yes, I make art too), Krita, Audacity, Bfxr (because sound effects are cool, okay?), Visual Studio (the one with all the errors), GitHub (obviously), Node.js (because I love pretending to be a backend developer too).

## My Repos That *Definitely* Matter:
- **[Pixel Heights](https://github.com/Aori297/pixel-heights)**: Help Kira find her missing keys and maybe figure out why she keeps losing them. It’s a game, not my life story... or is it?
- **[BirdBound](https://github.com/Aori297/BirdBound)**: You’re a bird. You flap. You go up. It’s a simple game.
- **[Blog App](https://github.com/Aori297/blogapp)**: A blog app. Because, the internet needed another one.
- **[Expense Tracker](https://github.com/Aori297/expense-tracker)**: For when you spend more money on snacks than you should. This app helps you track that bad decision-making.

---

## Things I *Might* Do If I Feel Like It:
- Actually finish my **FYP** game. (If I do, you’ll be the first to know… or maybe not. Who knows?)
- Maybe look into **AI in games** and **procedural generation**… or I could just stick to the basics and call it a day.
- Collaborate with someone who actually knows what they’re doing. (Hey, a guy can dream.)

Remind me that I still haven’t finished that game.
