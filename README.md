Oh, Hey there. You somehow ended up on my profile while scrolling through random devs. Well, I’m a game developer still figuring it all out, but hey, at least I’m trying. Right?

##  What I *Pretend* to Work On:
- **Game Development**: Currently making a 2D platformer where you help Kira, the world's worst keykeeper, retrace her steps. (Spoiler: She still doesn't have the key.)
- **Game Design**: Trying to make the most fun game ever, one bug at a time.

##  Technologies & Tools I *Pretend* to Know:
- **Languages**: C#, JavaScript, Python (I *can* Google the rest).
- **Game Engines**: Unity (because I like pretending I’m a pro), GDevelop (for when I don’t want to work too hard).
- **Tools**: Photoshop (yes, I make art too), Krita, Audacity, Bfxr (sound effects are fun, okay?), Visual Studio (the one with all the errors), GitHub (because how else would I look productive?).

##  My Repos That *Definitely* Matter:
- **[Pixel Heights](https://github.com/Aori297/pixel-heights)**: Help Kira find her missing keys and maybe figure out why she keeps losing them. It's a game, not my life story... or is it?
- **[Expense Tracker](https://github.com/Aori297/expense-tracker)**: For when you’re spending more money on coffee than on life choices. This app tracks it.
- **[Blog App](https://github.com/Aori297/blogapp)**: A blog app. Because, obviously, the internet needed another one.

##  Things I *Might* Do If I Feel Like It:
- Actually finish my **FYP** game. (You’ll be the first to know when I do… or maybe not.)
- Maybe learn **AI in games** and **procedural generation**… or maybe just stick to the basics and call it a day.
- Collaborate with someone who knows what they're doing. (Hey, a guy can dream.)

Remind me that I still haven’t finished that game.
